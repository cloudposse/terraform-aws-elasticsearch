# terraform-aws-elasticsearch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticsearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticsearch) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticsearch.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticsearch/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision an [`Elasticsearch`](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/) cluster with built-in integrations with [Kibana](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/kibana/) and [Logstash](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/logstash/).


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

This module will create:
- Elasticsearch cluster with the specified node count in the provided subnets in a VPC
- Elasticsearch domain policy that accepts a list of IAM role ARNs from which to permit management traffic to the cluster
- Security Group to control access to the Elasticsearch domain (inputs to the Security Group are other Security Groups or CIDRs blocks to be allowed to connect to the cluster)
- DNS hostname record for Elasticsearch cluster (if DNS Zone ID is provided)
- DNS hostname record for Kibana (if DNS Zone ID is provided)

__NOTE:__ To enable [zone awareness](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-managedomains.html#es-managedomains-zoneawareness) to deploy Elasticsearch nodes into two different Availability Zones, you need to set `zone_awareness_enabled` to `true` and provide two different subnets in `subnet_ids`.
If you enable zone awareness for your domain, Amazon ES places an endpoint into two subnets.
The subnets must be in different Availability Zones in the same region.
If you don't enable zone awareness, Amazon ES places an endpoint into only one subnet

## Usage

Basic [example](examples/basic)

```hcl
module "elasticsearch" {
  source                  = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticsearch.git?ref=master"
  namespace               = "eg"
  stage                   = "dev"
  name                    = "es"
  dns_zone_id             = "Z14EN2YD427LRQ"
  security_groups         = ["sg-XXXXXXXXX", "sg-YYYYYYYY"]
  vpc_id                  = "vpc-XXXXXXXXX"
  subnet_ids              = ["subnet-XXXXXXXXX", "subnet-YYYYYYYY"]
  zone_awareness_enabled  = "true"
  elasticsearch_version   = "6.2"
  instance_type           = "t2.small.elasticsearch"
  instance_count          = 4
  iam_role_arns           = ["arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role/ops", "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role/dev"]
  iam_actions             = ["es:ESHttpGet", "es:ESHttpPut", "es:ESHttpPost"]
  encrypt_at_rest_enabled = "true"
  kibana_subdomain_name   = "kibana-es"

  advanced_options {
    "rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index" = "true"
  }
}
```
